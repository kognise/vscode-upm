# VSCode UPM

A cross-language package manager workflow for VSCode based on [Repl.it's awesome UPM](https://repl.it/site/blog/upm).

## Demo

Here's a (relatively) old demo of VSCode UPM in action!

## Requirements

Refer to the [installation options](https://github.com/replit/upm#installation) to install UPM, which is required for this extension to run.

You'll need the native package managers of all the languages you want to use installed as well. E.g. `npm` for Node and `pip` for Python.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any bugs please submit them as an issue in our GitHub repository!

VSCode UPM is in preview and not meant to be used for big projects. I cannot assure you that it won't screw everything up, but I welcome feedback.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Added basic functionality.
